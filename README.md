## Context
A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this course, you will learn how to fight fraud by using data. For example, you'll learn how to apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior similar to past ones, as well as unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. Moreover, in fraud analytics you often deal with highly imbalanced datasets when classifying fraud versus non-fraud, and during this course you will pick up some techniques on how to deal with that. The course provides a mix of technical and theoretical insights and shows you hands-on how to practically implement fraud detection models. In addition, you will get tips and advice from real-life experience to help you prevent making common mistakes in fraud analytics.

## Content
This dataset is open source. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 are fraudulent. That is, only 0.172% of all transactions are fraudulent! This dataset is extremely unbalanced, and so training models to classify fraud is going to pose a challenge.
